		<h1>The LL-Coolest </h1>
		<p> Baja F. Fresh was born 2 years ago in Mexico. The owner "rescued" him when he was only 2 months old and his stomach was full of worms. He has since beaten those worms and living his life to the fullest. He is the greatest boy in the world and his owner misses him a lot.  A week ago, he was chased by 2 cayotes while he was "going to the bathroom" outside. The cayotes were feirce but Baja's screams were even fiercer. He ran around the outer perimeter of the house with a death, high pitched scream that let the whole neighborhood that he was in trouble. Long story short, Baja Fresh is a good, smart boy who his owner loves and misses very much.</p>
